### Comprehensive logout test

# Step 1: Login to get a token
POST http://localhost:3003/api/login
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "username": "perttu",
  "password": "secret"

# Step 2: Test that token works - create a blog (should succeed)
POST http://localhost:3003/api/blogs
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "title": "Test blog before logout",
  "author": "Test Author", 
  "url": "http://test.com"
}

### Step 3: Logout (should succeed and remove session)
DELETE http://localhost:3003/api/logout
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE

### Step 4: Try to create blog with same token (should FAIL with "session not found")
POST http://localhost:3003/api/blogs
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "title": "Test blog after logout - should fail",
  "author": "Test Author",
  "url": "http://test.com"
}
